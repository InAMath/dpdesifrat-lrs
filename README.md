## INSTRUCTIONS FOR MICROBIT

This is the program for Microbit which imitates decryption with the affine cipher (for b=2), but randomly shows letters L,R or S.

 A: selecting the letter you want to decript (for example let's say you choose letter F)
 
 B: selecting the key for decryption
 
 A plus B (at the sime time): chooses letter L, R or S randomly (for example let's say L) and shows: F -> L
